# Nederlands-Leren-Anki-Woordenboek
## Intro
Hoi allemaal, a'hello.

A friend of mine and I worked on a quick patch up to an existing Anki add-on, the Reviewer Context Menu Search (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/359618071), which is based on Glutanimate's addon (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/869824347).

The add on adds context menu entries for searching various online search providers.

## Showcase
Here's what it looks like on Anki, when you right click a word, you have the regular options to search it in various websites. Currently the default websites are Forvo, Reverse & the main feature of this app is the "Woordenboekdefinitie".

The "Woordenboekdefinitie" option uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the word definition in the website https://woorden.org/, a free Dutch dictionary.


Here's what it looks like when you select that option:

As you can see, if there are more than one definitions for one word, it *should* show them all in that Qt window.
